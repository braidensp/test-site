    <p>My test site is</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Simple</li>
      <li>Boring</li>
      <li>New beginning</li>
    </ul>

    <p>As I learn more, this project will advance with more and more complex things added to this site. I hope to one day become a freelance web developer and do what I love from home and spend as much time with my family as possible while still being able to support them. That is my dream and wish.</p>
